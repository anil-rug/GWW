# BACKEND ASSESSMENT

Programming has a solutions for everything so it's up to you to program a machine that allows us to rent transport!

The requirements for the Rent-O-Matic are listed below. See how far you can get in 2 hours but keep in mind, quality over quantity!

Write the program in code
Write UML diagrams for the models
Has to be interactive
Keep a state during runtime
Has the following functionality
help
list all vehicles
info about specific vehicle
rent a vehicle
pay rental costs
There should be different types of transport with their own properties (eg. bikes, cars, motorbikes, boats etc.)
The Rent-O-Matic needs to be able to provide change with the least amount of euro's using the following list of possible options: [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500].
There should be a inventory of transports that can be rented (eg. multiple cars).
At least one transport that is already rented and not available


# Programming Language
Scala 2.12.7

# Completed Logic

1. Vehicles are included in the code - hardcoded
2. Refresh Rentable list : Use 0 to refresh list
3. Rent a vehicle : Rents vehicle and returns the change
4. Added Use case diagram
